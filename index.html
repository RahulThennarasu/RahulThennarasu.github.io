                        Welcome! I’m <strong>Rahul Thennarasu</strong>, a first-year <em>Computer Science</em> student at <strong>Cal Poly SLO</strong> 
                        with a passion for technology and creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy tackling challenges at <strong>hackathons</strong>, where I collaborate with friends and strangers 
                        to build projects that are fun, helpful, and innovative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing one of my 
                        guitars (my current favorite is <em>classical</em>), exploring indie games, or going on walks with my dog to relax and recharge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to explore and learn more about me!
                    </p>
